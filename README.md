# A Tic Tac Toe game created using React.js and MiniMax Algorithm 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Minimax Algorithm:
Minimax is a kind of backtracking algorithm that is used in decision making and game theory to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that your opponent also plays optimally.
